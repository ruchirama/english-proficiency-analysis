STATISTICAL TESTING
===================

1. Testing Normality Assumption
Shapiro-Wilk test for Indian students: W=0.9680, p-value=0.1911
Shapiro-Wilk test for Foreign students: W=0.9563, p-value=0.0624
Conclusion: Both distributions appear to be normally distributed (p > 0.05)

2. Testing Homogeneity of Variances
Levene's test: W=0.0000, p-value=1.0000
Conclusion: Variances appear to be equal (p > 0.05)

3. Hypothesis Testing
Independent samples t-test: t=-1.5309, p-value=0.1290
Mann-Whitney U test: U=1034.5000, p-value=0.1360

4. One-way ANOVA
               sum_sq    df         F    PR(>F)
Student_Type   1.3225   1.0  2.343671  0.129015
Residual      55.3000  98.0       NaN       NaN

5. Effect Size Analysis
Mean proficiency score (Indian): 3.6300
Mean proficiency score (Foreign): 3.8600
Mean difference: 0.2300
Effect size (Cohen's d): 0.3062
Effect size classification: small

6. Equivalence Testing (TOST)
90% Confidence Interval for mean difference: [-0.4795, 0.0195]
Equivalence bounds: [-0.5, 0.5]
Conclusion: The groups are statistically equivalent (scores differ by less than the equivalence bound)

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION
====================
Based on the t-test (p = 0.1290), there is NO statistically significant difference in English proficiency between Indian and foreign students.
The effect size is small (Cohen's d = 0.3062), indicating that the practical significance of any difference is small.
Equivalence testing suggests that the groups are equivalent. (90% CI for mean difference: [-0.4795, 0.0195], equivalence bounds: [-0.5, 0.5])

Interpretation:
The data strongly supports the claim that there is no significant difference in English proficiency between Indian and foreign students based on country of origin.

Skill-specific insights:
- Speaking is the only skill area showing a statistically significant difference between the groups.
  Foreign students report higher fluency and confidence in spoken communication.
- At the postgraduate level, there is a significant difference in proficiency between Indian and foreign students.
  This difference is not observed at the undergraduate level.

Recommendations for future research:
1. Focus on speaking skills development, as this is the area with the most apparent differences
2. Investigate the reasons for postgraduate-level differences in proficiency
3. Consider controlling for years of English study and educational background in future analyses
4. Examine differences by specific country of origin rather than just 'Indian' vs. 'Foreign'
